                                Dr. Urmi Bajpai is a faculty and the founder teacher in-charge of the Department of Biomedical Science, introduced by the University of Delhi at Acharya Narendra Dev College in 1999. She got her PhD degree in Microbiology from the University of Delhi. Her vision and hard work has richly contributed in shaping B.Sc.(Hons) Biomedical Science course. Her focus is on giving hands on training to the students and make them independent learner. She is the pioneer of the Undergraduate research program in the college and has trained about hundred and fifty students since 2007. She has been sanctioned four research projects (funded by Govt of India) with a total grant of Rs. 7.7 Million and has established a well-equipped and modern molecular biology research laboratory. Through crowd sourcing undergraduates, she has developed a repository of gene (75) clones and recombinant proteins (21) of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative organism of Tuberculosis.<br />

                                Urmi is recognized by the University as a PhD guide. Her research interest is in finding multi-target therapy for tuberculosis. She is currently working on Mur pathway enzymes of Mycobacterium tuberculosis as the targets for discovering new TB drugs. She is also exploring the potential of Mycobacteriophages (a Pilot study) in finding diagnostic and therapeutic solutions to tuberculosis. Here again, by crowd sourcing, an attempt is being made to explore the diversity of Mycobacteriophages in India. Through these research projects, college students not only get trained in the modern techniques but also contribute in building of repositories, useful for the research community. <br />

                                Jörg Bentzien obtained a PhD in Chemistry from the University of Münster in Germany, working on computational studies of the photochemical [2+2] cycloaddition reaction in the lab of Professor Martin Klessinger. After working with the company Cheops, Münster, on a collaboration with Bayer Cropscience in Monheim, Germany, towards developing methods for lead optimization, he moved to the U.S. to conduct post-doctoral studies in the lab of Nobel Laureate Professor Arieh Warshel at the University of Southern California, Los Angeles. During this time he developed a QM/MM method to study enzymatic reactions. Jörg Bentzien then joined Xencor, Monrovia, California as a computational chemist to work on Protein Design. He is co-inventor of one of the early patents in the field of protein design and co-author on a paper describing a coupled computational and experimental screening approach to improve protein characteristics. <br />

Bentzien has worked as a computational chemist in early drug discovery on multiple programs in the areas of Immunology and Inflammation as well as Cardiometabolic Diseases. He developed several workflows for in silico ADMET property predictions widely used throughout the Medicinal Chemistry department. In 2012 Jörg was one of the lead scientists organizing the Boehringer Ingelheim sponsored Kaggle based crowdsourcing challenge on identifying a biological response. Together with David Thompson, Ingo Muegge, and Ben Hamner he published the results and experiences gained during this crowdsourcing challenge in 2013 in Drug Discovery Today.<br />

His work there focused on fragment-based docking for kinase ligands as well as chemoinformatic method development. After a short continuation as a postdoc in the same group, he joined the lab of Brian K. Shoichet at the University of California, San Francisco. This coincided with the publication of the structure of the first pharmaceutically relevant G-protein coupled receptor, a unique opportunity to carry out one of the first studies of xray-structure-based ligand design for this protein class. Besides docking to GPCRs, Kolb worked on the prediction of substrates for enzymes of unknown function, and has as such been contributing to the Enzyme Function Initiative.<br />
